 MySQL Data CRUD API with Python and Flask This project is a comprehensive guide to building a RESTful API for performing CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on a MySQL database using Python and the Flask framework. The API allows you to manage data efficiently and securely, making it ideal for various applications, from simple web apps to complex enterprise solutions.  Features Create: Add new records to the database.  Read: Retrieve existing records from the database.  Update: Modify existing records in the database.  Delete: Remove records from the database.  Authentication: Secure endpoints with user authentication.  Validation: Ensure data integrity with input validation.  Error Handling: Provide meaningful error messages for debugging and user feedback.  Technologies Used Python: The programming language used for building the API.  Flask: A lightweight web framework for Python.  MySQL: A popular relational database management system.  SQLAlchemy: An SQL toolkit and Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) library for Python.  Flask-RESTful: An extension for Flask that adds support for quickly building REST APIs.  Flask-JWT-Extended: An extension for Flask that adds JSON Web Token (JWT) support for securing endpoints.
